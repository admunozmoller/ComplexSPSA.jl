# Complex Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation

This repository holds the [julia](https://julialang.org) source code implementation of the CSPSA optimization method for real-valued functions of complex variables.

The CSPSA method corresponds to a complex generalization of [SPSA](https://www.jhuapl.edu/spsa/) method.

For more information, visit the [official documentation](https://complexspsa.netlify.app).
